Write a program with will ask a user what 3 social media websites they have heard of, then print out the URL of each site.

A URL looks like this: https://www.XXX.com

Your user will only enter the name of the site (XXX).  You must work with strings to build the URL and print it out.

You must verify the site works, by clicking the link.

Your program is complete when it:

1.	Prompts the user to enter the name of three sites
2.	Adds the site name to a list
3.	Uses a “for loop” to go through the list
4.	Prints out the correct URL
5.	Click the URL link and it works.
